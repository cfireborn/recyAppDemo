## Learn More

Prototyping process involved iterating on the product features depending on user behavior and the value they personally placed on the proposed discount rewards offered by the app. Users in the target demographic (USC students) were contacted and provided with an app MVP prototype, and asked to complete the sustainability game every day for a specific number of days. Developer would simply Venmo those users the cash value the user evaluated for their respective reward. Tracking user behavior in actually filling it out helped guide the app's streak requirements and rewards.
